# Stream Wallet App

Stream is a mobile wallet app developed in flutter.
It's not a fully functional since is only used for developing my front-end skills.
UI/UX is mainly based in a UI Kit shared on [figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/954041847470649704), created by Harum Shidiqi.

This app contains a simple but working authentication system using email and password based on Firebase.
User can make transactions through a very simple transaction system that has no connection to real world applications.
